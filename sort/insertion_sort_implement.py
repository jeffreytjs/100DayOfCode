# Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the insertion sort algorithm.
# Note: According to Wikipedia "Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds 
# the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large
# lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort."
