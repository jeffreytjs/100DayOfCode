# Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using shell sort algorithm.
# Note : According to Wikipedia "Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort. 
# It can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by insertion (insertion sort). 
# The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between
# elements to be compared. Starting with far apart elements can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than
# a simple nearest neighbor exchange."
