# Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the bubble sort algorithm.
# Note : According to Wikipedia "Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that
# repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the 
# wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. 
# The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. 
# Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. 
# It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly 
# in position.
