# Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the quick sort algorithm.
# Note : According to Wikipedia "Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can 
# sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. 
# In efficient implementations it is not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal 
# sort items is not preserved. Quicksort can operate in-place on an array, requiring small additional
# amounts of memory to perform the sorting."
