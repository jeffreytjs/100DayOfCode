# 100DayOfCode

This repo is to track my 100DayOfCoding Challenge and my aim here is to improve my Python knowledge and techinical skills. The problems are selected from a collection of coding challenges from [Udemy's Python Hand-on Solve 200 Problems](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-handon/).

It covers a wide range of topics which I will be using an overview to track my progress. Daily breakdowns can be found further below.
